Value streams allow a business to specify the value propositions for external  and internal stakeholders.

== Introduction
According to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Value_stream&oldid=912726011[Wikipedia on Value Streams]:

Value streams are artifacts within business architecture that allow a business to specify the value proposition derived by an external (e.g., customer) or internal stakeholder from an organization. A value stream depicts the stakeholders initiating and involved in the value stream, the stages that create specific value items, and the value proposition derived from the value stream. The value stream is depicted as an end-to-end collection of value-adding activities that create an overall result for a customer, stakeholder, or end-user. 

In modeling terms, those value-adding activities are represented by value stream stages, each of which creates and adds incremental stakeholder value items from one stage to the next.[1] While value streams are referenced in multiple methodologies, there is increasing agreement[2] on the description and the purpose of value streams as a core domain of _business architecture_ and _Scaled Agile Framework_, which has since been applied by multiple standards bodies.

There are multiple misconceptions around the concept of value streams. For clarification:

* Value streams are not processes in the sense that the concern is "how value is achieved" rather than "how it's done".

* Value streams are not associated with the Lean concept of value stream mapping. While named similarly, Lean value stream mapping is a process-based practice that seeks to identify waste, whereas value streams provide a higher-level overview of how a stakeholder receives value.
