Reference Architecture for <subject area>

image:../plattform_felles/media/i-arbeid.png[width=45, height=45] _This template is under construction._

ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: This template is based on the link:https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2017-10/sat_design_guidelines_0_0.pdf[Solution Architecture Template (SAT) Design Guidelines] as provided by EU in relation to the Europeean Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). Guidelines are given direcly in the template through notes like this, and has been adapted to the concepts and methods of the Norwegian National Architecture Library. Additional viewpoints and attributes have been defined. Among the most important extensions are chapters and viewpoints related to capability mapping. The guidelines should be hidden upon completion of the Reference Architecture or Architecture Pattern in question.

== Introduction
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: Write an introduction here. Sample contents are given below, to be adapted to the case in question.
endif::include_guidelines[]

This reference architecture serves as a Solution Architecture Template (SAT) for providing support to solution architects in the area of <the subject area in question>. 

== Document structure
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: Sample contents are given below, to be adapted to the case in question.
endif::include_guidelines[]

This SAT includes the following information elements: 

. Application of relevant, ecisting principles and identification of other, relevant principles. Viewpoints: Motivation.

. Specific requirements as relevant. Viewpoints: Motivation.

. Strategic outcomes. Viewpoints: Strategy.

. Capabilities and their interrelation as a description of the supported functionalities.Viewpoints: Capability Map.

. Identification of relevant resources at an abstract level, without reference to any specific building blocks (ABBs og SBBs). Viewpoints: Resource Map.

. Mapping of resources to Capabilities. Viewpoints: Strategy.

. Description of coutcome realization. Viewpoints: Outcome Realization.

. Description of the relevant value streams and how they are supported by the capabilities and resources in question (at an abstract level). Viewpoints: Value Stream or Business Process Cooperation. 

. Specification of a sub-set  of  the EIRA© core  Architecture  Building  Blocks  (ABBs)  covering  the four EIF layers.

. A set  of  specific  ABBs  extending  EIRA©'s  views  enabling  specific  functionalities  to  be provided by implementations derived from the SAT.

. The interoperability specifications of selected ABBs and a narrative for each EIRA©view. 


== Viewpoints
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: Remove or add viewpoints as necessary. The modelling tool should be used as master for viewpoint narratives and other attributes for the viewpoint as well as for building blocks and other elements.

Viewpoint attributes: TBD.

Building block attributes:

. dct:type
+
The type of the architecture building block

. dct:publisher
+
The name of the individual or organisation that is documenting the current building block

. dct:modified
+
The date that the information documented for this building block was last modified

. eira:url
+
The URL at which the specification can be referenced online

. eira:identifier
+
The  identifier  is  unique.  It  identifies  univocally  the  specification  in  the Cartography

. eira:body
+
The body contains statements on one or several Building Blocks. It informs either (i.e. proposed mode) on the proposed specification at the ABB level to  achieve  interoperability  for  its  SBBs  or  (i.e.  in  solution  descriptive mode) on a specification to which an SBB is actually compliant to achieve interoperability

. Additional attributes TBD.

=== Motivation
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: The motivation viewpoint allows the designer or analyst to model the motivation aspect, without focusing on certain elements within this aspect. For example, this viewpoint can be used to present a complete or partial overview of the motivation aspect by relating stakeholders, their primary goals, the principles that are applied, and the main requirements on services, processes, applications, and objects

=== Strategy
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: The strategy viewpoint allows the business architect to model a high-level, strategic overview of the strategies (courses of action) of the enterprise, the capabilities and resources supporting those, and the envisaged outcomes.
endif::include_guidelines[]

.Strategy Viewpoint example

NOTE: Guideline: The strategy viewpoint allows the business architect to model a high-level, strategic overview of the strategies (courses of action) of the enterprise, the capabilities and resources supporting those, and the envisaged outcomes.

=== Capability Map
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: The capability map viewpoint allows the business architect to create a structured overview of the capabilities of the enterprise. A capability map typically shows two or three levels of capabilities across the entire enterprise. It can, for example, be used as a heat map to identify areas of investment. In some cases, a capability map may also show specific outcomes delivered by these capabilities.
endif::include_guidelines[]

.Capability Map Viewpoint example

=== Resource Map
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: The resource map viewpoint allows the business architect to create a structured overview of the resources of the enterprise. A resource map typically shows two or three levels of resources across the entire enterprise. It can, for example, be used as a heat map to identify areas of investment. In some cases, a resource map may also show relationships between resources and the capabilities they are assigned to.

=== Outcome Realization
ifdef::include_guidelines[]
NOTE: Guideline: The outcome realization viewpoint is used to show how the highest-level, business-oriented results are produced by the capabilities and underlying core elements.
