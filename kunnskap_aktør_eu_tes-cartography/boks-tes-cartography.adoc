TES stands for Trans-European Solutions. A Trans-European solution is an operational Interoperable European Solution (IES) owned by the European Commission or other bodies (in some cases co-funded by MSs) in support to the implementation and advancement of EU policies. An Interoperable European Solution (IES) is an ICT interoperability solution, developed or used by Public Administrations that facilitates the delivery of electronic Public Services by supporting business capabilities involving cross-border exchange of information between Public Administrations and Public Administrations (or Citizens or Businesses) in support to the implementation and advancement of EU, national or local Public Policies.

The first stable version of the TES Cartography (TESCart v1.0.0) has been released on the 6th of October 2016. It includes 73 TES solutions, which can be accessed via the Cartography Tool (CarTool). Requests for access to the TES Cartography are welcome by sending an email to DIGIT-EIRA@ec.europa.eu, as the as access is restricted to European Commission officials.
