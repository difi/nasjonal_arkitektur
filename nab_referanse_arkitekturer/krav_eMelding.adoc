|Description

|Gen-Leg01
|Must follow the Norwegian
Interoperability principles and
the EIF principles
|Norwegian Interoperability Principles (Norske
Samhandlings Prinsipper) (Link)
European Interoperability Framework
Principles https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en

|Gen-Leg02
|Should follow the eIDAS regulations
|https://ec.europa.eu/digital-singlemarket/en/policies/trust-services-and-eidentification

|eDel-Leg01
|Must follow the set of principles set in the Norwegian eDelivery Strategy (Strategi for Norsk meldingsutveksling)
|Norwegian Strategy on eDelivery (Norsk strategi for meldingsutveksling) (Link)

|InfEx-Org01
|Must be easy accessible by Participants
|This requirement can be restated as "u se of Internet and Internet technologies" at the Technical level.

|eDel-Org01
|Must encapsulate a eDelivery community.
|That only participants cleared for the community is able to
send and receive event notifications and eDocuments.
With eDEL-Org01, this requires other measures than
physical division of communities e.g. by use of certificates.
|eDel-
Org02
|An eDelivery community must
share one interoperability
agreement
|The Interoperability agreement defines the eDelivery
community, those participants signing the agreement are
members of the community.
Avoiding bilateral interoperability agreements.
|eDEL-Org03
|Must be possible to participate
in mulitiple eDelivery
communities with own
interoperability agreements.
|A participant can be part of several interoperability
agreements e.g. eProcurement, eHealth, through a virtual
segmentaion of the eDelivery Infrastructure.

|eDELOrg04
|Transmission of Event
notifications and eDocuments
should be reliable.
|An Event notifications and eDocuments is delivered to the
receiver once and only once.
Level of reliability must be adressed in the Interoperability
agreement.
For additional reliability see ABB-eIDAS_Regulation
|eDELOrg05
|Transmission of Event
notifications and eDocuments
should be Secret.
|In some cases Secrecy is not a requirement, whereas in
other cases Secrecy is a "must" requirement.
Level of Secrecy must be adressed in the Interoperability
agreement.
For additional Secrecy see ABB-eIDAS_Regulation
|eDELOrg06
|Transmission of Event
notifications and eDocuments
should have Authenticity of
sender.
|In some cases Autheticity is not a strong requirement,
belonging to the eDelivery community is enough, whereas
in other cases Authenticity is a "must" requirement.
Level of Authenticity must be adressed in the
Interoperability agreement.
For additional Authenticity see ABB-eIDAS_Regulation
|eDELOrg07
|Transmission of Event
notifications and eDocuments
should be be with Integrity.
|In some cases eDocuments will be transformed e.g. from
one format to another, whereas in other cases Integrity is a
"must" requirement.
Level of Integrity and possibilities for transformation must
be adressed in the Interoperability agreement .
For additional Integrity see ABB-eIDAS_Regulation

|eDELOrg08
|Transmission of Event
notifications and eDocuments
can be Non-reputable.
|Non-repudiation is the creation of a digital Notification
and eDocument original e.g. neither parties can
dispute the sending and reception incl. the content.
In some cases Non-repudiation is not a requirement, trust
in the eDelivery community and the receiver is
enough, whereas in other cases, with high importance
Business Processes, Non-repudiation is a "must"
requirement.
Use of Non-repudiation must be adressed in the
Interoperability agreement .
For Non-repudiation see ABB-eIDAS_Regulation

|eDEL-Org09
|eDelivery must be flexible –
allow and handle participants
with different Business
Process interoperability maturity.
|Difference between participants in what business
processes are digitalized and what parts of a business
process is digitized.

|eDEL-Org10
|eDelivery must be flexible – allow and handle Business
processes and eDocuments with
different requirements.
|Valid Business Processes, Notifications and eDocuments must be adressed in the Interoperability
agreement .
See eDEL-Org04, eDEL-Org05, eDEL-Org06, eDEL-Org07,
eDEL-Org08

|eDEL-Org11
|eDelivery must be scalable –
number of participants
|An eDelivery community must be able to scale i.e. inherent
in the architecture is possibilities to make solutions that
doesn't put up barriers for scalability

|eDEL-Org12
|eDelivery must be scalable –
number of transactions
|An eDelivery community must be able to scale i.e. inherent
in the architecture is possibilities to make solutions that
doesn't put up barriers for scalability

|eDel-Sem01
|Must be possible to send
multiple eDocuments with an
Event Notification.
|An Event notification can be followed by multiple
eDocuments, that are relevant to initiate (and fullfill) a
Business Process on the receiving side.

|eDel-Sem02
|Must be eDocument agnostic. 
|Any type of Documents are supported e.g. XML, pdf, Doc.

|eDel-Sem03
|Must be able to exchange
eDocuments at a size < 2GB
|Current technical constraint.

|Must be based on Open
standards with high traction.
|Building the technical eDelivery (Meldingsformidling) on
Open standards that are

|eDel-Tec02
|Must have flexible Change
Management
|Possibility to change Building Blocks or versions in an easy
and flexible way e.g. «long» phase-in and phase-out of
technologies.

|eDel-Tec013
|Must accomodate competition
on solutions and service
provision
|Building the technical eDelivery (Meldingsformidling)
architecture on Open standards that are widely used
(traction)
Building the technical eDelivery
(Meldingsformidling) architecture such that it offers a wide
variaty of choices of participating e.g. directly or through
service providers (cloud based).
