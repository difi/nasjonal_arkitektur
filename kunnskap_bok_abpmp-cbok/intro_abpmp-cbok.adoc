practices.

document, measure, monitor, and control both automated and non-automated business 
processes to achieve consistent, targeted results aligned With an organization's strategic goals. 
BPM involves the deliberate, collaborative, and increasingly technology-aided definition,

results, create value, and enable an organization to meet its business objectives With more 
agility. BPM enables an enterprise to align its business processes to its business strategy, leading 
to effective overall company performance through improvements of specific work activities
