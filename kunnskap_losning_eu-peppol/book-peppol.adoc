[.lead]
PEPPOL is a set of artifacts and specifications enabling cross-border eProcurement. The use of PEPPOL is governed by a multi-lateral agreement structure which is owned and maintained by OpenPEPPOL.

== Introduction to PEPPOL

== The PEPPOL eDelivery Network
PEPPOL uses the eDelivery Network to connect different eProcurement systems by establishing a set of common business processes and technical standards. This provides an interoperable and secure network connecting all Access Points using the same electronic messaging protocol and formats and applying digital signature technologies to secure message content.

Once connected to the PEPPOL eDelivery Network (via a PEPPOL Access Point), public agencies and private enterprises can quickly and easily reach any other trading partner, also using PEPPOL.

 

In this context, PEPPOL provides:

* Technical specifications and sample software (open source)

* PEPPOL Transport Infrastructure Agreements – a legal framework for many-to-many interoperability
